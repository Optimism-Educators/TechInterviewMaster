### 3. **Git Commit Message**

We follow the **AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions**. Please ensure your commit messages are consistent with the project:

### 4. **Additional Notes**

- When adding new solutions or code files, create a `Solution.xxx` source code file.  
  If the file already exists, verify whether your algorithm or solution is more optimalâ€”if so, overwrite the existing one.
- Include relevant code snippets or explanations in the appropriate documentation files (e.g., `README.md`).
- Ensure that your contributions align with the goal of preparing for interviews, particularly in Python, R, Git, Excel, and Power BI.
- Follow the existing coding style in the project as closely as possible, including **naming conventions** for variables and functions.
