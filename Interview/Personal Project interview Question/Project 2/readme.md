#### **Description**  

Analyzed customer transaction data from an e-commerce platform to uncover purchasing patterns, segment users, and recommend targeted marketing strategies.  

- **Data Sources**: Public datasets (e.g., [Online Retail Dataset from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)), or synthetic sales data.  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  1. Performed **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers based on engagement.  
  2. Identified high-value, at-risk, and dormant customers using **K-means clustering**.  
  3. Visualized trends (e.g., seasonal purchases, product preferences) via dashboards (Tableau/Power BI).  
  4. Built a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering (e.g., cosine similarity for product suggestions).  
  5. Analyzed cart abandonment rates and proposed interventions (e.g., discounts for at-risk customers).

#### **Outcome**  

- Proposed personalized email campaigns and loyalty programs, projecting a **15% increase in repeat purchases**.  
- Highlighted underperforming product categories and recommended inventory adjustments.  
- Created interactive dashboards for stakeholders to monitor KPIs like CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) and churn risk.

### **Why This Project Stands Out**  

1. **Business Impact**: Directly ties to revenue growth, customer retention, and marketing efficiency.  
2. **Technical Breadth**: Combines SQL for data extraction, Python for analysis, and visualization tools.  
3. **Relevance**: Applicable across industries (e-commerce, SaaS, retail).

### **How to Present in Your Resume**  

**Customer Behavior Analysis | Python, SQL, Tableau**  

- Segmented 5,000+ customers into 4 groups using RFM and K-means clustering; identified top 10% high-value customers driving 40% of revenue.  
- Built a recommendation engine suggesting personalized products, increasing average order value by $12 in simulations.  
- Visualized seasonal trends and cart abandonment hotspots, leading to targeted campaign strategies.

### **Bonus Tips**  

- **GitHub Repo**: Share cleaned datasets, Jupyter Notebooks, and dashboard snapshots.  
- **Metrics**: Quantify results (e.g., "% increase in engagement," "X% higher click-through rate").  
- **Domain Knowledge**: Mention how insights align with business goals (e.g., reducing churn, upselling).
