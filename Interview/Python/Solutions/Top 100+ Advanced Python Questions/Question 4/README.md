# 🧠 Understanding Callables in Python

In Python, **callables** are objects that can be "called" like functions using parentheses `()`. If an object can be used like this:

```python
result = some_object()
```

Then `some_object` is **callable**.

---

## ✅ What is a Callable?

A **callable** is any object that implements the special method `__call__()`. This allows the object to be invoked like a regular function.

You can check if something is callable using the built-in `callable()` function:

```python
print(callable(len))  # True
print(callable(42))   # False
```

## 🔍 Types of Callables in Python

### 1. **Functions**

Defined using the `def` keyword or `lambda` expressions.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # "Hello, Alice!"
```

### 2. **Methods**

Functions that are bound to class instances.

```python
class Greeter:
    def say_hello(self):
        return "Hello!"

g = Greeter()
print(g.say_hello())  # "Hello!"
```

### 3. **Classes**

Calling a class returns a new instance of that class.

```python
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()  # MyClass is called
```

### 4. **Objects with `__call__`**

Any instance of a class that implements `__call__()` is callable.

```python
class Multiplier:
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, x):
        return x * self.factor

times_two = Multiplier(2)
print(times_two(5))  # 10
```

### 5. **Built-in Functions**

Python comes with many built-in callables like:

- `len()`
- `print()`
- `open()`
- `max()`
- `range()`

These are all callable objects.

## 🧪 Checking for Callability

Use the built-in `callable()` function:

```python
print(callable(len))         # True
print(callable("string"))    # False
print(callable(Multiplier))  # True
print(callable(times_two))   # True
```

## 📌 Summary

| Callable Type        | Example               |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Function             | `def foo(): ...`      |
| Lambda               | `lambda x: x + 1`     |
| Method               | `obj.method()`        |
| Class                | `MyClass()`           |
| Callable Object      | `instance()` if `__call__` is defined |
| Built-in Function    | `len()`, `print()`    |
