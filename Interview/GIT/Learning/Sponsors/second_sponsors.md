# ✅ Tips

- **Personalize** it slightly (mention their name if you know it).
- **Send it within 1-2 days** after someone sponsors you — fast thank-yous feel genuine.
- **Optional**: Mention 1-2 cool projects you’re working on they might be excited about!

# 🎯 Bonus Tip

After a few sponsors, you can also add a "**Hall of Sponsors**" page or section on your GitHub README to honor them!

Would you also like me to create a **cool “Thank You Badge”** you can give to your top sponsors (like a small image)? 🎖️🎨  
(If yes, it will make you look super professional too!) 🚀✨
